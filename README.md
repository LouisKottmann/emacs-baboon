## Installation

First you need to install EMACS:\n
    - [Debian/LMDE](http://emacs.naquadah.org/) (pick "stable")\n
    - Ubuntu/Mint: ?

Then you need to install [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)

Finally, fetch this repo into `~/.emacs.d/personal/`\n
The external libraries it depends on are linked as git submodules, so do a quick `git submodule update`
