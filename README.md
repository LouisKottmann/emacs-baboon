# Acknowledgments

I have consolidated this repository from lots of other people's public configurations, and a couple things stood out:

- [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) is easy to search, so if you want to use a package you can just search on Github: "use-package <name>" and get thousands of people's configs on that package. Helped me a lot.
- I used to be a [prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) user, and I ported lots of pieces from it. Many thanks to bbatsov and the contributors of that project.
- Nasy's config https://emacs.nasy.moe/ in literate programming format was a nice source of inspiration, albeit a bit over-complicated at times in my opinion (notably on company, I got too many cores to care about shifting backends around).

# General reasoning and features I desire

- Good, try-hard auto-completion. [Company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) with [lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode), [tabnine](https://github.com/TommyX12/company-tabnine), the works.
- As much fuzzy completion as reasonable
- [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) where it makes sense
- I believe [Smex](https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex/) still beats helm-M-x though
- Pretty shit everywhere. The software may be 40+ years old but not my current reality.
